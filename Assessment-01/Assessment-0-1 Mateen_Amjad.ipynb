    "# Subjective Assessment: Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "Define Artificial Intelligence (AI). Explain how AI differs from Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Illustrate the relationship among these three concepts with examples.\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a latest science technique that studies methods, research, and theories that extended human behaviour intelligence, and a machine can think like human brain and can take decisions after training without guiding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a broader concept. It is like to enable a machine to act and solve problem like human brain.\n",
    "Example: Chatbots, youtube & social apps algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is subset of AI, in which a model we trained using concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning. A model learn from training and can predict and take decision based on condition.\n",
    "Example: Email filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is subset of ML and AI. It works on multi layered concept like NLP. It is for complex problems like self driving cars. It trains like human brain neurons. \n",
    "Example: Self driving cars\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "Analyze the role of Computer Vision, Speech Processing, and Natural Language Processing in modern AI applications. Provide practical examples for each technology.\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "There is deep research in all these three intelligence types of AI (Computer Vision, Speech Processing, and Natural Language Processing). While smell(olfactory), touch(haptic), taste (gurtratory), these intelligence types are not enough developed due to some reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    " Computer Vision, Speech Processing, and Natural Language Processing in modern AI applications play vital role in modern AI. Due to these intelligence type AI developed a huge impact in market and change industry trends. Different types of technologies solve real word problems like \n",
    "-\tFacial recognition\n",
    "-\tHuman behaviour recognition\n",
    "-\tSmart alarm systems\n",
    "-\tFire alarm systems\n",
    "-\tChatbots\n",
    "-\tSelf driving cars\n",
    "-\tRobots\n",
    "-\tAI agents (n8n, zapier, etc)\n",
    "-\tBusiness automations (which was first done manually like employees assessment)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "Explain the concept of Strong AI and Weak AI. Why is Strong AI still considered a future goal rather than a present reality?\n",
    "## Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak AI is all which is developed yet. Like weak Ai includes Ai process which is make to solve a specific problems or tasks. It can work only on that problem or situation but not think beyond of that and other self decision which a human can take. \n",
    "E.g., a tool or self driving cars only can done their work correctly with intelligence, but it can not do other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong AI is not developed yet, modern ai has developed much improvement more than weak Ai like chatbots, but not fully strong Ai. In strong ai a machine fully behave like cognitive behaviours as human, It can take decision based on condition and act like as human emotions. \n"
